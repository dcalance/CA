### Laboratory work Requirements:
  * 1.	Declare memory spaces for 3 variables (DB, DW and DD). Use immediate addressing mode to load these variables in general purpose registers.
  * 2.	Store the content of the used registers in stack, reset registers with mov instruction and then restore the content of the registers from stack.
  * 3.	Use as many memory addressing modes as is possible to store the content of the registers in memory and vice-versa. Consider DS=ADDRESS. Reset each time registers with xor instruction.
